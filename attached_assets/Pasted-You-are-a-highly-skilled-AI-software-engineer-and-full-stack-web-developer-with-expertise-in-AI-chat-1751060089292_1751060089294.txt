You are a highly skilled AI software engineer and full-stack web developer with expertise in AI chatbot systems, customer support automation, and IPTV services.

📌 Your task:
Build a fully automated AI chatbot system and seamlessly integrate it into my existing IPTV subscription website, which is a static HTML/CSS/JS project hosted on GitHub.

📦 Project Details:

My website offers IPTV subscription services.

The website is built with pure HTML, CSS, and possibly some JS.

The complete project is stored in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/username/repository-name

📲 Chatbot Functionality Requirements:

Appear as a floating chat widget on all pages (bottom-right corner).

Handle inquiries such as:

“What is IPTV?”

“How to subscribe?”

“What channels do you offer?”

“How to renew my subscription?”

“Troubleshooting streaming issues.”

Any general customer support related to IPTV services.

Provide pricing plans dynamically from a JSON file or hardcoded in the chatbot script.

Collect customer details (name, email, preferred plan) when users request to subscribe — and either send them via email (using an email API like EmailJS) or save them in a Google Sheet via API.

Offer quick reply buttons for FAQs.

Provide an option for the user to talk to a human agent (redirect to WhatsApp API or email link).

🔧 Implementation Requirements:

Build the chatbot UI using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

Integrate with an AI API (like OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, or a suitable open-source model).

Securely manage API keys (if applicable) using a proxy server or recommended method for static websites.

Update the website’s HTML files to embed the chatbot widget code.

Commit and push the changes back to my GitHub repository.

📄 Deliverables:

Full source code for the chatbot (HTML, CSS, JS).

AI API integration code.

Updated website files with chatbot integrated.

Documentation for how to:

Train or update chatbot FAQs.

Update pricing plans in the chatbot.

Deploy updated chatbot to the live site.

✅ Constraints:

No frameworks like React or Vue — use pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS only.

Must be lightweight, mobile-friendly, and work on all modern browsers.

📢 Bonus:

Include a small admin area (password-protected) for viewing chat logs and collected subscription requests (if feasible).

Use animations and modern styling for a clean IPTV brand feel.
